# rigol_dg1022_tools
Perl command line tools to manage rdf wavform files for the Rigol DG1022.

I have developed some small utilities to manage waveform files for
the Rigol DG1022 arbitrary function generator (rdf files).
As I was interacting with LTSpice, I used its pwl format as a standard
and provided a function to convert LTSpice pwl files to rdf format.

More to come soon...
